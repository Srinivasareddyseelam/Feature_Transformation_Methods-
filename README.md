# Feature Transformation Methods

## Overview
This repository provides Python implementations of various feature transformation methods used in machine learning.

## Features Included
- **Scaling & Normalization**: Min-Max Scaling, Z-score Standardization
- **Encoding**: One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding
- **Binning**: Equal Width, Equal Frequency
- **Polynomial & Interaction Features**
- **Log & Power Transformations**
- **Feature Extraction**: PCA, LDA

## Why Feature Transformation?
Feature transformation is essential for improving the performance of machine learning models. It helps:
- Convert data into a more suitable format.
- Improve model accuracy and efficiency.
- Handle skewed data distributions.
- Enable algorithms to work with categorical and numerical data effectively.

## Example Usage
Run any script to apply transformations:
```bash
python normalization.py
```

Example for Min-Max Scaling:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import numpy as np

data = np.array([[1], [5], [10], [15]])
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
print(scaler.fit_transform(data))
```

## Common Applications
- **Data Preprocessing for ML Models**: Ensures numerical stability and better model convergence.
- **Image Processing**: Normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning.
- **Text Data Processing**: Encoding methods help convert categorical text into numerical features.
- **Medical and Financial Data Analysis**: Log transformations help deal with skewed distributions in real-world datasets.
